# AID Technology Stack

## Language Responsibilities

### MoonBit — Topology Calculation Kernel

**Used for:** `topology-calculator` WASM component, `aid-ui` frontend

**Why MoonBit:**
- First-class formal verification via `moon prove` (Z3 SMT backend, built into standard toolchain)
- Dual compile targets: `--target wasm` for the calculation kernel, `--target js` for the frontend
- Native WASM Component Model support (WIT bindgen tooling provided)
- "Agentic-first" design: strong typing and explicit contracts help LLMs generate correct proofs
- Smallest WASM binary output of any general-purpose language

**What it formally verifies in AID:**
- Port allocation non-overlap (no logical port allocated twice)
- Allocation completeness (total allocated == total demanded)
- Switch count lower bound (effective_quantity >= ceil(demand/capacity))
- BOM scaling (fleet_count == per_unit_count × quantity, at each level of the DeviceClass tree)
- Mesh constraint (switch count ∈ {2, 3})
- MCLAG even-count

**Key tools:**
- `moon` — build, test, prove
- `wasm-tools` — inspect/validate WASM components
- (`wit-bindgen moonbit` was used for the invented WIT contract; retired in #85 / D28)
- `moon prove` — run Z3 proofs against `.mbtp` predicate files

**Risks to manage:**
- MoonBit 1.0 is targeted for H1 2026 (stdlib still stabilizing)
- Formal verification scope: currently limited to pure functions (recursive/concurrent TBD)
- Small community and ecosystem
- See Phase 7 spike gate in `ROADMAP.md` before committing production code

### Rust — Adapters and WASM Components

**Used for:** `hhfab-adapter` and `bom-adapter` WASM components, `netbox-adapter`, plan schema validation

> **`bom-adapter` is Rust for the MVP** (Phase 4 architecture sign-off, issue #8), though
> this doc originally listed it under MoonBit. Rationale: under **D16** the Layer-2 boundary
> is JSON-over-linear-memory, so the adapter never links the kernel — the "reuse MoonBit
> kernel types" benefit disappears (and the kernel's BOM structs carry no `@json` codec, so
> MoonBit would hand-roll a decoder anyway, with no `kernel/` edits allowed). Rust instead
> reuses the merged `hhfab-adapter` Layer-2 pattern verbatim (ABI shell, `wasmi` smoke test,
> golden harness) plus the `csv`/`serde` crates. The BOM *test-data generator* stays MoonBit
> (it must call the kernel's `calculate()`), preserving the kernel reuse that actually matters.

**Why Rust:**
- `serde_yaml`: production-proven YAML serialization — no equivalent in MoonBit ecosystem
- `cargo-component`: first-class WASM Component Model tooling (Rust is the reference implementation language)
- `reqwest`: async HTTP client for NetBox REST API
- Memory safety model is philosophically aligned with MoonBit (no GC, ownership)
- `wasmtime` — the reference WASM runtime — is written in Rust, so Rust is the most natural host
- `clap` if CLI portions are written in Rust

**What Rust handles in AID:**
- Serializing `TopologyIR` to hhfab wiring YAML (Kubernetes CRD format)
- POST/PUT calls to NetBox REST API (Devices, Interfaces, Cables, Modules)
- JSON Schema validation of topology plan YAML files
- Any component where MoonBit's library ecosystem is insufficient

### Go — CLI, Orchestration, and Storage

**Used for:** `aid` CLI, `aid serve` REST API server, plan YAML read/write, SQLite state, WASM component hosting

**Why Go:**
- `cobra` + `viper`: the strongest CLI tooling ecosystem for this type of tool
- Single static binary output: trivial to distribute (`go build` → one binary)
- `wasmtime-go`: official Go bindings for the Wasmtime WASM runtime
- `mattn/go-sqlite3`: SQLite for local generated-state storage
- Fast compile-test loop for orchestration and I/O code
- `net/http` serves the frontend static assets and REST API from the same binary

**What Go handles in AID:**
- `aid plan create/validate/diff` — YAML plan I/O
- `aid topology calc/bom/export` — orchestrate WASM components and route output
- `aid publish netbox` — POST topology to NetBox via REST
- `aid serve` — REST API + static asset server for the web frontend
- Local state database (last IR hash, generation timestamps)
- Configuration management (`~/.aid/config.yaml`)

---

### MoonBit → JavaScript — Web Frontend

**Used for:** `aid-ui` — the browser-based GUI

**Compile target:** `moon build --target js` produces a JavaScript bundle that runs in any
modern browser. This is a separate MoonBit module from the WASM kernel — it uses the same
language but a different compilation target.

**Architecture:**
- MoonBit JS bundle handles all UI logic: rendering, state management, API calls
- Calls the Go REST API (`aid serve`) for all data — no direct computation in the browser
- No JavaScript framework dependency — MoonBit compiles to idiomatic JS
- Bootstrap 5 (bundled CSS + JS, not CDN) provides the visual framework

**Why not a separate JS framework (React, Svelte, etc.):**
- Keeping the frontend in MoonBit eliminates a second language from the stack
- MoonBit's type system applies equally to frontend logic — the same JSON data shapes
  the kernel boundary uses can be modeled in the UI layer (the kernel boundary is F2/F3
  JSON, not WIT, since #85 / D28)
- The design goal is NetBox-like appearance, not a sophisticated single-page app;
  Bootstrap 5 + MoonBit JS is sufficient

**Risks to manage:**
- MoonBit's JS target is newer than its WASM target — verify API surface stability
- MoonBit JS ecosystem has no npm interop; all UI primitives must be implemented
  in MoonBit or called via `extern` FFI from the JS runtime
- Bootstrap 5 component JavaScript (dropdowns, modals) is vanilla JS — compatible
  with MoonBit's JS output

## WASM Component Model

> **SUPERSEDED (DECISIONS D28, #85).** This section describes the pre-rebuild design.
> The invented WIT contract and the `wit/` files listed below were **deleted** in #85
> (Option A), and the Rust adapters were retired in F7d/D23. The live system has one
> WASM component — the proved MoonBit kernel — behind one Go host; its boundary is the
> **F2/F3 JSON-over-linear-memory** exports (`export_f2_calculate` / `export_f3_bom`),
> whose contract is the JSON shapes in `kernel/src/f2_types.mbt` + `f3_bom.mbt` plus the
> executable golden tests in `internal/wasmhost/golden_boundary_test.go`. The BOM and
> wiring renderers are Go packages (D23), and `wit-bindgen` is no longer used. The text
> below is retained for historical context only.

AID uses the WASM Component Model (WIT interfaces, Canonical ABI) for all inter-component
boundaries. This is not an internal implementation detail — it is the primary architectural
boundary mechanism.

**Why WASM Component Model:**
- Language-independent: each component's implementation can change without affecting others
- Formally specified interfaces: WIT is machine-readable and tool-generated
- Enables third-party extension: anyone can implement a new export adapter against the published WIT
- Browser portability: WASM components can run in a browser for a future web UI

**WIT interface files (in `wit/`) — deleted in #85 (D28); listed for history only:**
```
wit/
  world.wit                 # top-level world definition
  topology-calculator.wit   # inputs/outputs for the calculation kernel
  hhfab-adapter.wit         # TopologyIR → wiring YAML
  bom-adapter.wit           # DeviceClassBOM[] → CSV/JSON
  netbox-adapter.wit        # TopologyIR + config → NetBox publish result
```

**Component composition:**
The Go CLI uses `wasmtime-go` to host all WASM components. Components do not call each
other directly — the CLI orchestrates all inter-component data flow.

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Language | Framework | Approach |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Topology kernel | MoonBit | `moon test` + `moon prove` | Unit tests + formal proofs |
| Adapters | Rust | `cargo test` | Unit tests, golden file tests |
| CLI + integration | Go | `go test` | Integration tests using fixture YAML files |
| Behavioral contract | Go | `go test` | Acceptance tests: fixture YAML → expected IR counts |
| Frontend | MoonBit JS | `moon test` | Component unit tests; visual review against Bootstrap 5 reference |

**Fixture YAML as behavioral contract:**
The topology plan YAML files from the reference architecture catalog
(see `HNP_REFERENCE.md` for source) serve as acceptance test inputs. For each fixture,
AID must produce correct:
- device count, interface count, cable count
- per-fabric switch counts
- BOM totals per device class (hierarchical)
- valid wiring YAML (hhfab validate)

These counts are the ground truth derived from the HNP reference implementation and
captured in `tests/fixtures/` alongside the plan YAML.

## Development Environment

```bash
# MoonBit
moon --version       # check installation
moon build           # build all targets
moon test            # run tests
moon prove           # run formal proofs

# Rust
cargo build          # build all crates
cargo test           # run tests
cargo component build  # build WASM components

# Go
go build ./...       # build all packages
go test ./...        # run all tests

# Compose final WASM components
wasm-tools compose aid-topology-calculator.wasm hhfab-adapter.wasm -o aid.wasm
```

No containerized runtime is required for AID development — all components run natively
or are hosted by the Go CLI.
